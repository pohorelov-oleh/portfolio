# KRPK.NET — Order Website for the "Kryvoozerska" Bakery 🍞  
<a href="https://krpk.net/Demo/Client/Main" target="_blank">View krpk.net demo version</a>

**KRPK.NET** is a modern website for managing orders between retail outlets and the **"Kryvoozerska"** bakery, implemented using **ASP.NET Core MVC**, **Entity Framework Core**, and **MSSQL Server**.

The platform automates the process of:
- order creation,
- returns processing,
- data export to an ERP system,

which **reduces the load on call center operators** and **minimizes the risk of human error**.

---

## Prerequisites for System Creation  
<a href="https://krpk.net/Demo/Client/Main" target="_blank">View krpk.net demo version</a>

Before the system was implemented, all orders were accepted via operator calls to retail points. This led to typical issues:

- 📵 inability to reach the client and vice versa;  
- ❌ lost orders;  
- 🧍‍♀️ additional workload on staff;  
- 🧱 reputational risks in partner interactions.

---

## ✅ Result

**KRPK.NET** allowed to:
- transfer **part of the clients** to self-ordering via an online cabinet;  
- ensure **order history retention**;  
- perform **.CSV export for ERP systems**.

📦 At the end of the workday, operators simply **download a convenient file** from the system — and upload it into the accounting software.
