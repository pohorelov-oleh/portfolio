### 🧩 Non-Technical Experience

Before fully transitioning into .NET development, I worked at the company **LLC "Kryvoozerska HSF"**, which includes mineral water production, a bakery, distribution, and its own retail chain.

- **System Administrator**: setup of local networks, POS equipment, software integration, office hardware support.
- **Internship in all areas of the business**: production, distribution, logistics, retail — to gain a complete understanding of the company's structure.
- **Assistant to the Commercial Director**: sales analytics, participation in the development of motivation systems, interaction with regional managers.
- **Marketing and PR**: development of the brand's TikTok and Instagram, video production, organization of promo activities.
- **Integration of external services**: setup and launch of **Spot2D** and **Spot2R** systems by **PraData** — for monitoring product presence in retail locations and tracking field activities.
